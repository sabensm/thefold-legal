<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="subtitle"><span class="app-name">The Fold - Recipe Vault</span> &middot; Effective February 14, 2026</p>

<p>Slip3 Studios ("we", "us", or "our") built The Fold - Recipe Vault ("The Fold", "the App") as a commercial application. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our App.</p>

<p><strong>The short version:</strong> Your recipes and data stay on your device and in your personal iCloud account. We never see, access, or sell your data. We have no servers, no analytics, and no ads.</p>

<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

<p><strong>We do not collect any personal information.</strong> The App does not have user accounts, does not require registration, and does not transmit any data to our servers because we do not operate any servers.</p>

<p>All data you create in the App (recipes, meal plans, shopping lists, photos, and Circle memberships) is stored locally on your device and synced to your personal Apple iCloud account using Apple's CloudKit framework.</p>

<h2>2. Device Permissions</h2>

<p>The App may request the following device permissions, each of which you may decline:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Camera:</strong> Used to scan handwritten recipe cards using on-device optical character recognition (OCR). Images are processed locally and are not transmitted anywhere.</li>
    <li><strong>Photo Library:</strong> Used to attach photos to your recipes. Photos are stored in your iCloud account, not on our servers.</li>
    <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> Used to send local reminders for meal planning. Notifications are generated on-device and do not pass through any external service.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. iCloud and Data Sync</h2>

<p>The App uses Apple's iCloud and CloudKit services to sync your data across your devices. This data is stored in your personal iCloud account and is governed by <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/">Apple's Privacy Policy</a>. We do not have access to your iCloud account or any data stored within it.</p>

<h2>4. Circles (Shared Recipe Groups)</h2>

<p>The Circles feature allows you to share recipes with family and friends through Apple's CloudKit sharing infrastructure. When you create or join a Circle:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Shared data (recipes, photos, and posts) is stored in iCloud and visible only to Circle members.</li>
    <li>Apple manages all sharing permissions and access control.</li>
    <li>We have no visibility into shared content or Circle membership.</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Recipe Import</h2>

<p>When you import a recipe from a URL, the App fetches the webpage content directly from your device to extract recipe data. This request is made from your device to the website you specify. We do not proxy, log, or store any imported URLs or content.</p>

<h2>6. Purchases and Subscriptions</h2>

<p>The App offers optional premium features through in-app purchases managed entirely by Apple's App Store and StoreKit framework. We do not collect or have access to your payment information, billing details, or Apple ID. All transactions are governed by <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/">Apple's Terms and Conditions</a>.</p>

<h2>7. Analytics and Tracking</h2>

<p><strong>We do not use any analytics, tracking, or advertising frameworks.</strong> The App contains no third-party SDKs for analytics, crash reporting, or advertising. We do not track your usage, behavior, or any other activity within the App.</p>

<h2>8. Third-Party Services</h2>

<p>The only third-party service the App interacts with is Apple's iCloud/CloudKit for data storage and sync. We do not integrate with any other third-party services, ad networks, or data brokers.</p>

<h2>9. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>

<p>Since all data is stored locally on your device and in your personal iCloud account:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>To delete your data:</strong> Delete your recipes and content within the App, or delete the App from your device.</li>
    <li><strong>To delete synced data:</strong> Manage your iCloud storage through your device's Settings &gt; [Your Name] &gt; iCloud.</li>
    <li>We retain no data on any servers because we operate no servers.</li>
</ul>

<h2>10. Children's Privacy</h2>

<p>The App is rated 4+ and does not knowingly collect any personal information from anyone, including children under 13 (or under 16 in the European Economic Area). Because the App collects no personal data, no special provisions for children's data are necessary beyond what is already described in this policy.</p>

<hr>

<h2>11. Your Rights Under GDPR (European Economic Area)</h2>

<p>If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA), you have certain rights under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Because we do not collect, store, or process any personal data on our systems, most GDPR provisions are addressed inherently by our architecture. Specifically:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Right of Access:</strong> All your data is in your iCloud account, which you can access at any time through your device or <a href="https://privacy.apple.com">Apple's Data and Privacy portal</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Right to Rectification:</strong> You can edit any data directly within the App at any time.</li>
    <li><strong>Right to Erasure:</strong> You can delete any or all data within the App or by deleting the App. See Section 9.</li>
    <li><strong>Right to Data Portability:</strong> The App allows you to export recipes as PDF files.</li>
    <li><strong>Right to Object / Restrict Processing:</strong> We do not process your data. All processing occurs locally on your device.</li>
    <li><strong>Data Protection Officer:</strong> Given that we do not process personal data, we have not appointed a DPO. For questions, contact us at the address below.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Legal Basis for Processing:</strong> To the extent any processing occurs (e.g., on-device OCR), it is performed locally on your device under your control and is based on your consent when granting device permissions.</p>

<h2>12. Your Rights Under CCPA / CPRA (California)</h2>

<p>If you are a California resident, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) grant you specific rights regarding your personal information:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Right to Know:</strong> We do not collect personal information. No data is sold, shared, or disclosed to third parties.</li>
    <li><strong>Right to Delete:</strong> You control all your data locally and in your iCloud account. See Section 9.</li>
    <li><strong>Right to Opt-Out of Sale or Sharing:</strong> We do not sell or share your personal information with any third party. There is no data sale to opt out of.</li>
    <li><strong>Right to Non-Discrimination:</strong> We do not discriminate against you for exercising any of your privacy rights.</li>
    <li><strong>Sensitive Personal Information:</strong> We do not collect sensitive personal information as defined by the CPRA.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information:</strong> We do not sell or share personal information. No opt-out mechanism is necessary because no sale or sharing occurs.</p>

<h2>13. International Data Transfers</h2>

<p>Your data is stored by Apple in accordance with their data storage practices. Apple may store iCloud data in data centers located in various countries. For details on how Apple handles international data transfers, please refer to <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/">Apple's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

<hr>

<h2>14. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated effective date. We encourage you to review this page periodically. Your continued use of the App after changes are posted constitutes your acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
